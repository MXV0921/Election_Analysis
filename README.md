# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

As Data Analysts we are given raw data in many forms. For this project we are given the results of an election in .CSV(comma separated value) format. By utilizing Python code we can import the data from this file and sort this data into an easily readable format. In this project we were able to write code that allowed us to tabulate the results of an election for 3 counties in Colorado, then calculate and print the results of the election and export into a separate .txt file.
