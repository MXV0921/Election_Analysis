# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

As Data Analysts we are given raw data in many forms. For this project we are given the results of an election in .CSV(comma separated value) format. By utilizing Python code we can import the data from this file and sort this data into an easily readable format. In this project we were able to write code that allowed us to tabulate the results of an election for 3 counties in Colorado, then calculate and print the results of the election and export into a separate .txt file.

## Election-Audit Results

- How many votes were cast in this congressional election? 
    By utilizing the following code we were able to define a variable as an integer, and begin tracking this value at zero:
    
 # insert initializing png
    
    After defining the variable we added more lines of code to help us to tabulate the total votes counted in the election:
  
  #insert adding votes png
    
    Further down in our code we can used the code below to print the total votes placed in the data we uploaded:
    
    #insert printing vote total png
        
- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.

- Which county had the largest number of votes?

- Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

- Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
